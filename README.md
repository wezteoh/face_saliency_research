This repository is created for a research to study the correlation of the face recognition process by human brain and by machine learning models.

The augmented version of VGG-16 model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) used is programmed by referring to the works of Davi Frossard (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/vgg16/vgg16.py) whereas the augmented AlexNet model (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) is programmed by referring to the works by Michael Guerzhoy (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/)
